# Murasaki üå∏
Murasaki is a multimedia library designed to help you track and enhance your Japanese immersion journey. It seamlessly manages your anime and visual novel library while logging your immersion time, providing insightful statistics to monitor your progress. 

Writen in blazing-fast Svelte and Rust, Murasaki aims to be a lightweight option for serious learners. This application is built on the Tauri framework, combining web technologies with native performance for a responsive and efficient experience. 

## Key Features
- Unified library management for anime and visual novels
- Automatic time tracking to log your immersion activities
- Activity heatmap to monitor consistency and streaks
- Seamless media launching that integrates your preferred players

## Roadmap
Here are the improvements that I would like to make to Murasaki, presented in order of priority:
- Graph that measures cummulative immersion over time on the dashboard
- Per-content statistics displays in the details section of each piece of media
- Browser extension to track immersion on YouTube or „ÉÉ„ÉÑ Ebook Reader

## Installation
[TODO: Include releases]

### Requirements
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later
- **macOS (Untested)**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later

## About 

Murasaki was born from my personal journey learning Japanese through immersion. After getting annoyed with constant local file management, I decided to build something that could help me (and hopefully others) track their progress more effectively.

If you find this tool helpful in your language learning journey, I'd love to hear about it! Feel free to reach out to me with any feedback that you might have.
